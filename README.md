# MARKER-BASED AUGMENTED REALITY APPLICATION FOR LEARNING ANATOMY

The study of anatomy is very important in health sciences as it provides basic knowledge about the human body and as well as the fundamental concepts on how the human body functions. There is a growing interest in teaching and learning in virtual environments
particularly with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).
The goal of this project was to create an augmented reality application that will aid students in their study of anatomy by allowing them
to visualize and examine various anatomical 3D models from different sides and angles, making the study of anatomy simpler, more participatory
and interactive. Unity3D and the Vuforia SDK were used to develop the marker-based Augmented Reality application for this project. The marker used for
this study comprised six (6) print outs of unique QR code images
put together to form a cube which when scanned displayed different
sides of the 3D model under study.
The application also made the affordance for interacting with
the different parts of the anatomical model on display using finger
gestures. This interaction and input was made possible with the technique of Raycasting.

PS: This repository contains all resources for the Anatomy application. Much of the program logic is found in the objectclicker.cs file.
